Object Oriented Programming

- Real world actors : Visulize them as entities (data) in the software - Objects
    - def name = 'mehul chopra' - String object
    - def age = 32 - Integer object
    - def pi = 3.14 - BigDecimal object
    - def lightsOn = true - Boolean object

    - Class
        - Entity using which objects can be created in the system: 1 to n
        - It gives a data type to an object
        - Blueprint for an object
- Characteristics of real world actors : Visualize them as attributes of the Object
    - Declare the attributes in the class

- Actions on real world actors : functions called on the Object
